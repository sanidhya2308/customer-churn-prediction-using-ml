🔍 From raw data to actionable insights — turning features into predictions

I recently completed a Machine Learning Classification project where I implemented a full data science pipeline using Python and Scikit-Learn, focusing on model performance, evaluation, and interpretability.

🧠 Project Highlights

This project covers the entire ML lifecycle, including:

✅ Data Handling & Preprocessing

Data loading and exploration using Pandas & NumPy

Label Encoding for categorical variables

Feature scaling using StandardScaler

Train–test split for unbiased evaluation

✅ Model Building

Logistic Regression (baseline, interpretable model)

Random Forest Classifier (ensemble learning for improved accuracy)

✅ Model Evaluation

Accuracy Score

Confusion Matrix

Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-Score)

ROC Curve & AUC Score for probability-based evaluation

✅ Visualization & Insights

Confusion Matrix heatmaps

ROC Curve comparison

Performance interpretation using Matplotlib & Seaborn

📊 Key Learnings

🔹 Ensemble models like Random Forest can significantly outperform linear models
🔹 Feature scaling improves convergence and stability
🔹 ROC-AUC provides better insight than accuracy for imbalanced datasets
🔹 Visualization is critical for explaining results to non-technical stakeholders

🛠 Tech Stack
